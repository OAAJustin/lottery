    "A Python script has been created to connect to the SQL database and make calls to the data table. The data had been previously stored in a Google Sheets file with sheet tabs for each vendor. The column headers in the sheet and the SQL database have been made uniform for easy import. Each sheet had been downloaded to a csv file and stored in a folder titled Inventory. The Python script looped through the Inventory folder and read each of the files extracting the name of the artist from each files name, along with each item in the table, enumerating each new item and creating a pandas dataframe. The script then makes a connection to the My SQL server as well as the VSG database and makes a call to the table asking for its last UID number and if there isn't one, then it is set to 0. This is used to correctly increment the items in the Pandas dataframe to the SQL data table when imported. The script finally inserts the data from the Pandas dataframe into the table on the My SQL server. "
